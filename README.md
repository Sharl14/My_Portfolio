# Portfolio — Sharlene Pillay

This is a minimal, responsive portfolio template. It is plain HTML/CSS/JS so you can edit it quickly.

Files created:

- `index.html` — main page
- `css/styles.css` — styles
- `js/script.js` — small UI script + demo projects
- `package.json` — convenience script to run a static server

How to run (quick):

Option A — Open locally

- Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use VS Code Live Server).

Option B — Run a local static server (PowerShell):

```powershell
# from project root
npx http-server . -p 3000 -c-1
# then open http://localhost:3000
```

Option C — Use npm script

```powershell
npm install -g http-server # optional to install globally
npm run start
```

What I can do next (pick any):

- Customize text, bio, skills and add your real contact email
- Add real project cards with images and links
- Add a resume download and a contact form (Netlify/Forms or server endpoint)
- Deploy to GitHub Pages or Netlify and I can prepare the steps

Tell me which name, email, projects (titles + descriptions + links) and color preferences you want and I’ll customize the site for you.
